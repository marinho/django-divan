OVERVIEW

Divan is toolkit for building applications with models whose schemas can be
modified by the end user.  This is achieved with a combination of a SQL
database and CouchDB.

Divan provides an abstract model class, ``BaseOption``, which applications
subclass and use to define the fields that will appear in a form/"model"
instance.  Subclasses of the ``CouchForm`` class provided in ``divan.forms``
then declare a couple of attributes that provide the bridge between CouchDB and
the SQL database:

    class ExampleOption(BaseOption):
        pass

    class ExampleForm(CouchForm):
        class Meta:
            database = 'example'
            model = ExampleOption
            server = 'http://myserver.com:5984/'

If not defined, ``server`` will default either to settings.DEFAULT_COUCH_SERVER
or CouchDB's own default, which is http://localhost:5984/.

Please see the example app included.
